# Tryunfo Game !

The idea with this project is to create a game, where the user can create his own cards with the desired attributes and after created, be able to use these cards to battle with other cards, where the card that has the highest selected attribute wins.

In addition to this, the user can also add filters to the search of the cards created, including applying cascading filters.
